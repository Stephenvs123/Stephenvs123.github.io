# Recognition and Growth — When Your Garden Finally Gets Sunlight ☀️

There's a difference between a plant that survives and one that thrives.

For years, I felt like I was just surviving — producing output, meeting deadlines, but always under pressure, with recognition scarce.

Then I changed environments, and everything shifted.

## The Shift

In my previous role, the pressure was constant. I learned tremendously, but there was always this underlying current of "not enough."

When I joined Senwes, my team lead gave me something I hadn't fully experienced before: **recognition for contributions and space to grow intentionally**.

Instead of "Why isn't this done yet?" → "Great work on solving that complex problem."
Instead of "Just ship it" → "Take time to understand the business context."

It was like moving a plant from a cramped, dark corner into open sunlight with rich soil.

## The Multiplying Effect

Here's what I discovered: **genuine recognition creates a multiplying effect**.

When someone recognizes my contribution, I feel valued, invest more deeply, take initiative, and help others grow. The team gets stronger — rising tides lift all boats.

And now, I get to pay it forward.

## To Leaders

If you're in a position to give recognition, understand this: **it's not a nice-to-have — it's essential infrastructure**.

Your team needs recognition like a garden needs sunlight. Without it, they might survive, but they won't thrive.

## Final Thought

Recognition is the sunlight that helps gardens grow. Your best work happens when you're thriving, not just surviving.

Find the soil and sunlight that let you flourish. 🌱
