# My Developer Journey

I often think back to my childhood when my dad would stay up late playing games with me. It wasn’t just the games themselves — it was **how he asked questions** that made me think critically and explore multiple ways to solve problems. I quickly learned that for every challenge, there’s more than one approach — a mindset that programming later amplified.  

Programming gave me a **new lens** to approach problem-solving. It wasn’t just about writing code; it was about **thinking logically, anticipating outcomes, and building solutions that work**. This mindset still drives me every day as I tackle both new and legacy systems.

## First Steps

Studying at **CTU** opened my first major door into the professional world. The structured learning helped me **solidify core programming principles**, and gave me the confidence to be productive from day one in my first role.  

The biggest challenge during this time wasn’t syntax or frameworks — it was **building a solid foundational knowledge** that I could consistently fall back on. Every new technology I’ve learned since then builds on that foundation. Even today, I make it a point to **strengthen the basics**, because they always pay dividends in complex projects.

## Growth and Domain Experience

Transitioning between industries has been an eye-opening journey. Moving from **BBD in banking** to **Senwes in agriculture** required a complete shift in thinking about business logic. Banking projects often focused on **transactions, compliance, and strict process flows**, while agriculture demanded **flexibility, real-world operational insight, and adaptability**.  

One of the biggest confidence boosts came from my **team lead at Senwes**, who gave me the freedom to explore, question, and truly understand the business. His challenges forced me to **rethink processes, refactor approaches, and grow into a more versatile developer**, eventually expanding my role to include **DevOps responsibilities**. This experience taught me that understanding the “why” behind business logic is just as important as writing correct code.

## How I Work

My approach to coding is simple but intentional: **understand the “why” and the “how.”**  

Before writing a single line of code, I make sure I deeply understand the business requirement. Asking *“Why are we doing this?”* helps me anticipate issues, find better solutions, and **deliver software that truly benefits the organization**.  

I also focus heavily on testing and validation. Every solution I deliver is **well-tested, maintainable, and aligned with business needs**, so it can be relied upon in production with confidence.

## Passion Projects & Self-Growth

> “Cosplaying as a sysadmin” – my approach to self-learning and hands-on growth  
{: .prompt-tip }

Outside work, I love building **self-hosted applications and solutions** at home. This hands-on experimentation challenges me to explore **Docker, networking, cloud integration, and infrastructure** in ways that directly enhance my DevOps skills.  

These personal projects aren’t just experiments; they’ve **influenced how I approach deployment and system management at work**, giving me a deeper understanding of underlying hosting mechanics and real-world reliability concerns.

## My Tech Stack

I work across the **full stack** and DevOps ecosystem, including:  

**ASP .NET** | **C#** | **TypeScript** | **Angular** | **Python** | **SQL** | **Azure** | **Docker** | **AWS**  

I enjoy learning new technologies but rely on these core tools to **build robust, scalable, and maintainable systems**.  

---

## Challenges Along the Way

Every career has hurdles, and mine came in the form of **industry transitions, new technologies, and constantly raising my own standards**. Each challenge forced me to **adapt, learn, and grow**, shaping the mindset I have today: resilient, solution-focused, and always ready to take on new problems.

---

## Vision for the Future

I want to be **the go-to developer** — the one my team relies on when facing tough problems. I aim to **drive innovation, improve legacy systems, and guide teammates** toward better solutions.  

Beyond the technical, I strive to be **friendly, approachable, and collaborative**, making time to mentor others while still pushing projects forward.
