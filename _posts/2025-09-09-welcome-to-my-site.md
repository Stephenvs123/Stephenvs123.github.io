# Welcome ðŸŽ‰

Hi there â€” and welcome to my corner of the web!  

This site is where Iâ€™ll share my thoughts, experiences, and projects as I continue to grow as a developer. Think of it as both a **digital notebook** and a **place to connect** with anyone who shares a love for coding, technology, and problem-solving.

## Who I Am  

Iâ€™m **Stephen Van Sittert**, a Senior Developer with several years of experience building systems across industries like **banking, agriculture, and aviation**.  

Iâ€™ve always seen programming as more than a profession â€” itâ€™s a craft and a daily challenge that keeps me curious. My background is rooted in **ASP .NET, C#, and TypeScript**, but Iâ€™ve also worked extensively with **Python, Angular, SQL, Azure, Docker, and AWS**.  

At my core, Iâ€™m someone who:  

- enjoys tackling problems head-on,  
- learns quickly through curiosity and exploration, and  
- loves making the web a little better every day.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here  

This site isnâ€™t just a static portfolio â€” itâ€™s an evolving space. You can expect posts about:  

- **Development insights**: from .NET deep dives to modern front-end practices.  
- **Tools & experiments**: things I tinker with outside of work.  
- **Personal journey**: lessons learned along the way, both technical and career-related.

## Looking Ahead

This is only the beginning, and Iâ€™m excited to see how this space grows. If anything resonates with you, donâ€™t hesitate to connect.  

Hereâ€™s to building, learning, and sharing along the way. ðŸš€
