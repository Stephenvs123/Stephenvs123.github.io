# Recognition and Growth — When Your Garden Finally Gets Sunlight ☀️

There's a difference between a plant that survives and one that thrives. Both might be green, both might look functional from a distance, but only one is truly growing.

For years, I felt like that surviving plant — producing output, meeting deadlines, shipping features — but always under pressure, always feeling like the work was never quite enough. Recognition was scarce, and growth felt more like an accidental byproduct than an intentional cultivation.

Then I changed environments, and everything shifted.

## The Pressure Garden: Surviving vs. Thriving

In my previous role, the pressure was constant. Don't get me wrong — I learned a tremendous amount during those years at BBD. I built my core technical skills, worked on large-scale enterprise systems, and developed the discipline that still serves me today.

But there was always this underlying current of *not enough*. Ship faster. Do more. Fix this. Why isn't that done yet?

It's like farming in poor soil with no irrigation — you can keep things alive through sheer effort, but the harvest is never what it could be. You're too busy fighting fires to tend the garden properly. And when the harvest does come, there's rarely a moment to celebrate before the next planting cycle begins.

**The cost of constant pressure:**
- No space to experiment or learn deeply
- Growth happens by accident, not intention
- Contributions feel invisible
- Energy goes to survival, not innovation
- You start to doubt your own value

## Finding Fertile Ground: The Shift to Recognition

When I joined Senwes, something fundamental changed. It wasn't just a new company or different technology stack — it was a completely different approach to growth and development.

My team lead gave me something I hadn't fully experienced before: **recognition for contributions and space to grow intentionally**.

Instead of:
- *"Why isn't this done yet?"* → I heard *"Great work on solving that complex problem"*
- *"Just ship it"* → I heard *"Take time to understand the business context"*
- *"Figure it out yourself"* → I heard *"Let's explore this together"*

It was like moving a plant from a cramped, dark corner into open sunlight with rich soil. Suddenly, growth wasn't something I had to fight for — it was expected, encouraged, and celebrated.

## The Growth Loop: When Recognition Multiplies

Here's what I discovered about genuine recognition: **it creates a multiplying effect**.

When someone recognizes my contribution, something shifts:
1. **I feel valued** — my work matters beyond just completing tickets
2. **I invest more deeply** — if it matters to others, I want to do it even better
3. **I take initiative** — I start seeing opportunities instead of just tasks
4. **I help others grow** — because I know how powerful recognition is
5. **The team gets stronger** — rising tides lift all boats

At Senwes, this loop started turning. My team lead recognized my ability to dive deep into business logic, so I invested more time understanding the agricultural domain. That deeper understanding made me more effective. That effectiveness earned trust. That trust created opportunities to take on DevOps responsibilities. Those responsibilities helped me grow into new areas.

And now, I get to pay it forward.

## Helping Others Grow: The Best Kind of Growth

There's something deeply satisfying about helping teammates grow. When I review someone's code, I don't just check for bugs — I look for opportunities to share knowledge, explain context, and recognize good thinking.

When a junior developer solves a tricky problem, I make sure the team knows. When someone asks a great question that makes us all think differently, I call it out. When a colleague ships something solid, we celebrate it.

**What I've learned about helping others:**
- Recognition doesn't diminish when shared — it multiplies
- Teaching forces you to understand concepts more deeply
- Watching someone have their "aha moment" is incredibly rewarding
- A stronger team makes everyone more effective
- You learn as much from mentoring as from being mentored

The farming metaphor holds perfectly here: **the best gardeners don't just tend their own plot — they help the whole garden flourish**.

## What Recognition Actually Looks Like

Recognition isn't about participation trophies or empty praise. It's about genuinely *seeing* the work and the person doing it.

**Meaningful recognition:**
- Acknowledges specific contributions, not generic "good job"
- Happens in the moment, not months later in a review
- Comes from understanding the actual complexity of the work
- Creates space for the person to build on that success
- Encourages experimentation and learning, even from failures

**What it's NOT:**
- Pressure disguised as urgency ("great work, now do three more")
- Conditional approval ("you're valuable only when you ship")
- Public praise with private criticism
- Recognition only for "hero" moments, not steady contributions

---

## The Before and After

### Before: The Pressure Environment
- Constant urgency with little space to breathe
- Contributions felt invisible or taken for granted
- Growth happened in survival mode
- Learning was squeezed into after-hours
- Burnout always lurked at the edges
- Celebrating wins felt like wasted time

### After: The Recognition Environment
- Steady progress with room to explore
- Work is seen and valued
- Growth is intentional and supported
- Learning is part of the job, not extra
- Energy goes to building, not just surviving
- Wins are celebrated as team milestones

The difference isn't just in how I feel — it's in the quality of work I produce, the depth of solutions I create, and the impact I have on the team.

## Growing By Helping Others Grow

One of the unexpected gifts of working in a recognition-rich environment is that **I get to model it for others**.

When I help a teammate understand a complex system, I'm not just transferring knowledge — I'm showing them they're worth investing in. When I take time to explain the "why" behind a decision, I'm recognizing their intelligence and curiosity. When I celebrate their wins, I'm saying "you matter."

And here's the beautiful part: **every time I help someone else grow, I grow too**.

- Explaining concepts deepens my own understanding
- Seeing fresh perspectives challenges my assumptions
- Watching others succeed reminds me why this work matters
- Building a stronger team creates better systems for all of us

It's not a zero-sum game. Recognition and growth multiply when shared.

## Practical Ways I've Changed

Since moving to an environment that values recognition, here's what I do differently:

**As a team member:**
- I speak up about wins, both mine and others'
- I share credit generously
- I ask "why" without fear of seeming incompetent
- I experiment knowing failures are learning opportunities
- I invest in understanding business context deeply

**As a mentor:**
- I look for opportunities to recognize good work
- I explain the reasoning behind technical decisions
- I create space for others to explore and question
- I celebrate progress, not just perfection
- I make time for teaching, not just doing

**As a developer:**
- I focus on sustainable solutions over quick hacks
- I document for future team members
- I refactor with confidence knowing it's valued
- I invest in observability and maintainability
- I build systems others can grow with

---

## The Ripple Effect

When you work in an environment where recognition flows freely, the effects ripple outward:

- **Better code** — because you have space to do it right
- **Stronger teams** — because people feel valued and invested
- **More innovation** — because experimentation is encouraged
- **Lower turnover** — because people want to stay and grow
- **Sustainable pace** — because burnout isn't the cost of shipping

It's the difference between extracting maximum output from depleted soil and cultivating rich, living earth that produces harvest after harvest.

## To Leaders: Recognition Isn't Optional

If you're in a position to give recognition, understand this: **it's not a nice-to-have — it's essential infrastructure**.

Your team needs recognition like a garden needs sunlight. Without it, they might survive, but they won't thrive. And if you're only focused on output without tending to the people producing it, you're mining resources, not cultivating a garden.

**How to create a recognition-rich environment:**
- Notice specific contributions and name them
- Create space for learning, not just shipping
- Celebrate wins as a team, not just at review time
- Ask "what do you need to grow?" and actually provide it
- Trust people with challenges, then recognize how they meet them
- Make mentorship part of the culture, not an extra

---

## To Those Still in the Shadow: It Gets Better

If you're currently in a pressure-filled environment where recognition is scarce, know this: **it's not you, it's the soil**.

Some gardens are just poorly tended. That doesn't mean you can't grow — but it might mean you need to find different ground.

In the meantime:
- Recognize yourself and your own progress
- Find peers who value and see you
- Keep building your skills even when they're not celebrated
- Document your wins for yourself
- Remember that pressure doesn't equal growth
- Start planning your move to better soil

You deserve to thrive, not just survive.

## Final Thoughts — Sunlight and Rich Soil

The move from constant pressure to genuine recognition changed everything for me. Not just my job satisfaction, but my entire approach to growth, learning, and helping others.

I'm building better systems now — not because I'm working longer hours, but because I have the space to do it right. I'm growing faster now — not because of pressure, but because growth is encouraged and recognized. I'm helping others more effectively now — because I know the power of being seen and valued.

**Recognition is the sunlight that helps gardens grow.**

If you're a leader, give it freely. If you're a teammate, share it generously. If you're searching for it, keep looking — there are gardens out there that know how to cultivate growth.

Your best work happens when you're thriving, not just surviving. Find the soil and sunlight that let you flourish.
