# Think Like a Farmer - My Bonsai Approach to Software Growth üå±

I first fell in love with solving puzzles at home - late-night games with my dad where he‚Äôd nudge me to try a different move, a different strategy. That same curiosity followed me through CTU, my early roles, and all the way into the cross-industry work I do today. The farmer analogy for software - preparing soil, planting with purpose, respecting seasons, weeding, and celebrating harvests - resonates with me because it mirrors how I‚Äôve built my craft: slowly, intentionally, and with care.

This cover image of a bonsai captures that idea perfectly. A bonsai isn‚Äôt a shortcut; it‚Äôs the visible result of small, patient decisions. That‚Äôs how I prefer to build software: steady, deliberate, and focused on long-term health.

## 1. Prepare the Soil: Foundations matter

Before a farmer plants anything, the ground must be ready - drained, fed, and mapped. In software, that means investing in foundations: clean architecture, solid automated tests, reliable CI/CD pipelines, and practical documentation. During my early years at CTU and in my first roles, I focussed on learning fundamentals that would let me ship confidently. Foundations don‚Äôt look flashy, but they make the difference between a one-off hack and a system that scales.

## 2. Plant with Purpose: Choose intentionally

Farmers choose crops that fit the soil and climate. As developers, we should pick technologies and features that fit the problem - not every new framework is the right fit. When I moved from banking at BBD to agriculture at Senwes, the context changed; so did the choices I made. Picking the right tool for the right job saved time, reduced friction, and gave the teams faster wins.

## 3. Respect the Seasons: Know when to grow and when to prune

Not every season is for new features. Sometimes you need to refactor, pay down technical debt, or simply stop and plan. In busy teams, pressure to deliver can feel like spring all year - but sustainable systems need fallow periods. My team lead at Senwes gave me room to learn and challenge assumptions; that permission to slow down and understand the business was the exact kind of seasonal thinking that helped me grow into DevOps responsibilities.

## 4. Weed Relentlessly: Remove what chokes progress

Weeds look harmless until they choke your field. In code, weeds are dead branches: unused features, outdated libs, and crufty scripts. I make pruning part of my routine: remove the things that add cognitive load, keep dependencies tidy, and clean up quick-and-dirty hacks. Those small removals free the codebase to breathe and make new growth healthier.

## 5. Celebrate the Harvest: Pause and own wins

Farmers celebrate harvest because it‚Äôs the outcome of sustained toil. In teams, we ship releases and then-too often-move straight on to the next task. I try to flag releases, share the wins, and reflect with the team. Celebrations build morale and remind everyone that the tending paid off.

## How this maps to my work

* **Foundations**: My time at CTU gave me the fundamentals that made me productive from day one and into bigger systems. I still invest in those basics because they‚Äôre the soil everything else grows from.

* **Context & Purpose**: Moving from BBD to Senwes changed the business logic I worked with. The freedom to ask ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and to rebuild my understanding of the domain was essential - and it taught me to choose solutions suited to the business.

* **Hands-on infrastructure**: I enjoy what Jeff Geerling calls ‚Äúcosplaying as a sysadmin.‚Äù My home lab and self-hosted projects pushed me into Docker and infra work, which directly influenced how I approach deployments and reliability at work.

## A practical checklist I use

* Spend more time on design and tests before writing code.
* Ask ‚Äúwhy‚Äù - not just ‚Äúhow‚Äù - for every new feature.
* Schedule regular cleanup windows (dependabot + manual pruning).
* Treat deployments as milestones and celebrate wins.
* Keep experimenting in a controlled way (feature toggles, canaries).

## Final thoughts - tend for the long game

Software rarely flourishes because of a single sprint; it grows from many small choices made over time. The bonsai on the cover is a reminder: small, deliberate changes compound into something strong and beautiful. If you treat your codebase like a living thing - prepare the soil, plant with purpose, prune carefully, and celebrate the harvest - you‚Äôll end up with systems that last.
