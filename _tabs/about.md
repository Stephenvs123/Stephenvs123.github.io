# Hi, Iâ€™m Stephen ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Stephen Van Sittert**, a passionate programmer who thrives on curiosity, learning, and solving complex problems.  

From the start of my career, Iâ€™ve always approached programming with enthusiasm â€” not just as a job, but as a craft I want to sharpen every single day. I see every new challenge as an opportunity to **grow, experiment, and build**.

## My Journey

- (Feb 2024 â€“ Present)  
  *Senior Developer at Senwes*  
  Today, I work as a Senior Developer, where I design and implement solutions that support critical business operations. My focus has shifted from just writing code to mentoring others, guiding technical decisions, and making sure systems scale with reliability.  

- (Oct 2017 â€“ Feb 2024)  
  *Full Stack Developer at BBD*  
  For over six years, I contributed to large-scale enterprise systems in the banking sector. This experience gave me a strong foundation in **.NET, Angular, SQL, and Azure**, while teaching me the importance of maintainable code and collaborative teamwork.  

- (Oct 2016 â€“ Oct 2017)  
  *Developer at Jonker Sailplanes*  
  My first professional role gave me exposure to real-world problem-solving â€” building tools and applications that directly supported aviation engineering.  

- (Jan 2018 â€“ Present)  
  *Self-Employed & Lifelong Learner*  
  Outside of my day job, I constantly explore new technologies. I code daily, contribute to projects, and stay sharp by experimenting with ideas â€” from backend services to cloud infrastructure and modern frontends.

## My Core Skills

Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed a strong set of technical skills, with my **core expertise in ASP .NET, C#, and TypeScript**. Alongside these, I have hands-on experience with **Python, Angular, SQL, Azure, Docker, and AWS**, allowing me to work across the full stack and adapt to different environments quickly.  

Beyond tools and frameworks, I bring qualities that matter most in a developer: Iâ€™m a **hard worker**, a **quick learner**, and above all, a **problem solver**. These are the traits I carry into every project, whether Iâ€™m building enterprise-grade applications or experimenting with personal ideas.

## Why I Code

At the heart of it, I love **building solutions that matter**. Whether that means creating enterprise software for financial services, experimenting with cloud-native apps, or hacking together personal projects, coding gives me the freedom to turn ideas into reality.  

I believe in an open web, in sharing knowledge, and in leaving behind systems that are cleaner, faster, and easier to use than when I found them.

## Looking Ahead

Iâ€™m always open to opportunities where I can **grow, contribute, and collaborate** â€” whether itâ€™s through building products, mentoring teams, or solving unique technical challenges.
